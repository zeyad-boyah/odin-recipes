    <h1>Italian Potato Salad</h1>
    <img src="../pictures/pictures.png" title="italian potato salad">
    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Born vegan, this is a classic potato salad that can be found on Italian tables from the North to the South. In Italy, you'll find it everywhere: formal luncheons, family get-togethers, weeknight dinners, and even in hospital and school cafeterias. Many Italians add cooked green beans. Leftovers are delicious tossed with pesto and pasta. Buon appetito!</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>25 ounces Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rock salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and slightly crushed</li>
        <li>2 green onions (white part only), chopped</li>
        <li>Â½ cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine potatoes and salt in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are tender, but not mushy, about 10 minutes depending on size. Drain and set aside until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>While potatoes are cooking, whisk 3 tablespoons olive oil and white wine vinegar together in a small bowl. Add garlic and set aside.</li>
        <li>Peel cooked and cooled potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine potatoes, green onions, and parsley in a bowl and lightly toss. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil mixture and lightly toss, taking care not to break the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Top with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and red pepper flakes right before serving.</li>
    </ol>
